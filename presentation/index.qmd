## Contents

-   Motivation
-   



::: notes
-   the motivation of the pilot plant studies, why these investigations were made
-   for the overview of the pilot plant operation, show the timeline of the sewer pilot plant operation and the
-   motivation for my research - maybe consider adding 2-3 slides in this section
:::

## Research Overview

something about the figure here ![](images/Fig%201-1_Thesis_structure.svg)

## Supporting Pilot Plant Investigations

-   Residence time distributions
-   Sulphide build-up in the pressure sewer
    -   Key parameters related to the sulphide formation
    -   Impact of quiescent conditions
-   Air flow in gravity sewers

::: {.fragment}
**Additional experiments**

- Onsite sulphide measurements
- Calibration of UV spectrometer (TriOS) for continuous monitoring of <span style="color: red">key parameters</span>
- COD Fractionation- Wastewater biodegradbility
:::

## Focual Point: Mitigation Strategies for H<sub>2</sub>S
- add a driagram giving an overiview of the countermeasures applied
- for each countermeasurs applied., give the reason for its usage

## Free Nitrous Acid
